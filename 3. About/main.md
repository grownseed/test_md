# About the centre for clinical genomics

The Centre for Clinical Genomics (CCG) is based within [Canadaâ€™s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca/) (GSC) and is supported by the [Provincial Health Services Authority](http://www.phsa.ca) (PHSA). Further partnerships with the clinical laboratories of the [Lower Mainland Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Services](http://www.phsa.ca/AgenciesAndServices/Services/PHSA-Labs/Contacts.htm) provide extensive diagnostic experience and consultation. These partners work together to ensure timely and accurate delivery of clinically-actionable information required to ensure excellent patient care.

Clinical diagnostic genomic testing is rapidly becoming a standard of care for many hereditary and acquired conditions and this integrated partnership will see that demand met with quality service provision. As this testing demand grows, we require novel strategies to address testing capacity and capability. The CCG is well-placed to implement novel genomic technologies, and harness the significant bioinformatic expertise residing at the GSC for data analysis and interpretation.

The GSC has extensive, world-renowned expertise in adopting cutting edge technology for genomics applications combined with innovative and internationally-recognized bioinformatic capabilities. The CCG provides high throughput sequencing for genomic diagnostics in CAP ([College of American Pathologists](http://www.cap.org/)) accredited laboratories. The combination of technical, informatic and clinical expertise ensures that genomic diagnostics will be delivered with high-quality and confidence.
